              Any initiative that makes it easier for companies and employees to increase their use
              of stock options is a welcome one. We applaud Ledgy for helping entrepreneurs in
              Germany to set up robust and fair virtual stock option schemes. Our hope is that
              legislators in Germany will make reforming stock option policies a priority in 2020,
              allowing employees to receive real stock options, not just virtual ones.
